# Welcome to my technical notes space

This site is a collection of personal notes gathered from my experiments and projects, mainly focused on Kubernetes and its ecosystem.

What you'll find here isn't polished tutorials or official documentation. It's snippets of config, handy commands, real-world troubleshooting, and sometimes solutions to specific issues I've run into in production environments. Some notes might be incomplete or lack context — that's expected, since they were originally written for my own use.

I decided to publish them because, in my experience, you often run into weird edge cases that aren’t documented anywhere. If these notes can save someone a few hours debugging an obscure issue or figuring out a tricky setup, then it's worth it.

**Happy reading — and good luck hunting bugs.**
